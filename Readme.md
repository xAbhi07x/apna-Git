  ```

  - `<filePath>`: The path to the file you want to version.
  - `--message`: Optional commit message describing the changes.

- **Compare File Versions**

  Use this command to compare two different versions of a file:

  ```bash
  abhi compare <filePath> --version1 <version1Name> --version2 <version2Name>
  ```
